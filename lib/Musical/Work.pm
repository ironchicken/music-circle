# Transforming Musicology -- Music Circle
#
# Music Circle is a social music collaboration tool developed by
# Matthew Yee-King and colleagues on the PRAISE project at Goldsmiths'
# College, University of London. This project implements a similar
# Web-based musical commenting system, but working with existing
# musical works rather than uploaded audio performances.
